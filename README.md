# OPEN-CV
Image recognition using haarcascade openCV
Open CV(open computer vision) is used to analyse the images received from a image capture source like a webcam
it's uses range from simple face detection to complex applications like Forensics and crime applications
This project focuses on basic applications like detecting Face , eyes and recognising smile 
PROCESS:
  1. initially download the haarcascade OPENCV licensed files from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades
  2. Then use the jupyter Notebooks attached in the repositry for code reference
  3. Run the code and note the results
  4. please note that in order for it to work, there needs to be an active image capture source like a webcam
